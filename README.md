# Password Manager

HOW TO RUN: My project does not need any special extensions, it should work on any platform I tried it on onlineGDB and it worked! 
just make sure you have all the files downloaded and then just run it.

My project is a password manager, a program that can handle many different users and their unique data, I was really inspired to make this
program becasue it could be on my resume, this program utilizes encryption and decryption and therefore it can standout on my resume
as a cybersecurity student. This program lets users register an account in order to log in, they can change their log in password if they wish to do so after logging in,
This program saved the user data as (App Name, User Name, Password) so when a user wants to see their data they can see the app's name, username and their pass for that app.
The user can also edit any of the data they have or even delete any records that they want, along side this the user ask the program to generate a strong password for them
and also they can test their password strength and let the program tell them whether they have need a stronger password.
